## Review
- ### Architecture
    The Bank System project is built using a monolithic architecture, which means that both the front end and back end are combined into a single application. The user interface is developed using JavaFx, which is a Java-based GUI framework that allows developers to create rich client applications. The backend database is implemented using MySQL, a popular open-source relational database management system.

- ### Development
    The Bank System project was developed at an early stage in the programmer's career. Despite this, the project demonstrates the ability to create a functional application that addresses real-world business needs. The monolithic architecture used in the project is a simple yet effective approach for building applications that do not require complex scalability or distributed architectures.

- ### Conclusion
    Overall, the Bank System project is a useful tool for managing member accounts and transactions for Sanasa Bank. The project demonstrates the use of JavaFx for the front end and MySQL for the backend database, as well as the use of a monolithic architecture for building simple yet effective applications.
